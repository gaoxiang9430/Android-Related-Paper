## Android Vulnerability Type

### Crypto related
#### [Block cipher algorithm ASE in ECB mode](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/eedb39c05c6bd35a9d90672f99c1a79ffaccb341/Crypto/BlockCipher-ECB-InformationExposure-Lean/?at=master)
The attacker could create a similar content(such as 2222222222222222anniemaes@gmail.com over anniemaes@gmail.com) to trick benigh app to encrypt it. Since the encrypted data will be same is anniemaes@gmail.com is encrypted twice. Therefore the attacker could guess the sensitive data.
Meanwhile, if a constant key embeded statically in the source code. This is also a security vulnerability.

#### [Block ciper algorithm AES in CBC mode with NonRandomIV](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/eedb39c05c6bd35a9d90672f99c1a79ffaccb341/Crypto/BlockCipher-NonRandomIV-InformationExposure-Lean/?at=master)
If an app use ASE in CBC mode with constant Initiallization Vector(IV), then encrypting a particular piece of information twice will generate same result. Attacker could figure out the sensitive data by querying with guessing value.

### Web related
#### [UnsafeIntentURL Loading](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/fc3b6c536789/Web/UnsafeIntentURLImpl-InformationExposure-Lean/?at=master)
If an app has a component C that displays web pages and that component does not sanitize the URI before acting on it then a malicious web page could embed an intent to a malicious component installed in the device. When the user interacts with the URI, she ends up interacting with the malicious component.
